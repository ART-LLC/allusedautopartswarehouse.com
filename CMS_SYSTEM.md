## Authentication

All CMS endpoints require admin authentication via the existing admin session system:

```typescript
// Session is checked via cookies (httpOnly)
// Configured in ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variables
```

**Credentials** (no defaults; admin login is disabled until ADMIN_PASSWORD is set):
- Email: admin@auapw.com
- Password: <value of ADMIN_PASSWORD>

Login at: `/admin/login`

---

## Portal Navigation

The system includes a portal switcher component (`PortalSwitcher`) that allows quick navigation between:
- Content Manager (Admin)
- Sales Team Portal
- Support Team Portal

Each portal maintains its own context and data.

---

## Activity Tracking

All actions in the CMS are logged to `portal_activity_log`:

**Tracked Actions**:
- `created`: New content created
- `updated`: Existing content modified
- `deleted`: Content archived
- `published`: Content status changed to published

**Logged Information**:
- Who made the change
- What changed
- When it changed
- Which team/portal was used
- Additional details about the change

---

## Content Versioning

The system automatically maintains revision history:

- Each update to a page creates a new revision
- Revisions include:
  - Previous content
  - Revision number
  - Author
  - Change description
  - Timestamp

This allows reverting to previous versions if needed.

---

## Team Roles

### Role Permissions

- **Owner**: Full control over team portal
- **Manager**: Can create, edit, and approve content
- **Editor**: Can create and edit content (requires approval)
- **Viewer**: Read-only access

### Assigning Roles

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/cms/team-roles \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "user_123",
    "teamType": "sales",
    "role": "manager"
  }'
```

## Content Organization

- **Types**: page, blog, faq, policy
- **Status**: draft, published, archived

---

## Best Practices

1. **Use Meaningful Slugs**: Create URL-friendly slugs (e.g., `shipping-policies`, `faq-returns`)
2. **Write Good Descriptions**: Add SEO descriptions for search engine visibility
3. **Organize Content**: Use categories to keep content organized
4. **Track Changes**: Always include a change description when updating
5. **Version Control**: Check revision history before making major changes
6. **Status Workflow**: Keep content in draft until ready, then publish
7. **Team Boundaries**: Assign team roles to manage access control

---

## Integration with Frontend

### Fetching Published Content

```typescript
// Example: Fetch published pages
const pages = await fetch('/api/admin/cms/pages?status=published')
const data = await pages.json()
```

### Displaying Dynamic Content

```typescript
// In your page component
async function getPageContent(slug: string) {
  const res = await db
    .select()
    .from(contentPages)
    .where(
      eq(contentPages.slug, slug) && 
      eq(contentPages.status, 'published')
    )
  
  return res[0]
}
```

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Admin Authentication**: All CMS endpoints require valid admin session
2. **HTTPS Only**: Use HTTPS in production
3. **Session Timeout**: Admin sessions expire after 8 hours
4. **Audit Logging**: All actions are logged for compliance
5. **Status Archiving**: Soft delete instead of hard delete for data preservation

---

## Troubleshooting

### Pages Not Showing
- Verify page `status` is 'published'
- Check `teamType` matches access permissions
- Ensure page slug is unique

### Revisions Not Saving
- Verify database write permissions
- Check `content_revisions` table for errors

### Portal Access Issues
- Verify admin session is valid
- Check `/api/admin/auth/session` endpoint
- Ensure credentials are correct
