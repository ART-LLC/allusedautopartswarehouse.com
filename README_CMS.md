Access revision history from the edit view.

- Fill in SEO fields for better search visibility
- Write clear change descriptions when editing
- Use proper categories and tags
- Keep content organized
- Review before publishing
- Archive old content instead of deleting

### DON'T ❌
- Use special characters in slugs
- Leave SEO fields empty
- Create duplicate content
- Mix unrelated content
- Forget to publish drafts
- Delete content permanently
- Keep sensitive info in drafts

---

## 🔗 Integration with Frontend

### Display Published Content

```typescript
// In your Next.js page component
import { contentPages } from '@/lib/db/schema'

async function getPage(slug: string) {
  const [page] = await db
    .select()
    .from(contentPages)
    .where(
      eq(contentPages.slug, slug) &&
      eq(contentPages.status, 'published')
    )
  return page
}
```

### Fetch from Frontend

```typescript
// Client-side React component
const [articles, setArticles] = useState([])

useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api/admin/cms/support?status=published')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => setArticles(data.content))
}, [])
```

See [CMS_INTEGRATION.md](./CMS_INTEGRATION.md) for detailed examples.

## 📊 Activity Tracking

All CMS actions are logged to `portal_activity_log`:

- Who made the change
- What type of resource changed
- What action was performed (create/update/delete/publish)
- When the change occurred
- Specific details of what changed

Use this for:
- Compliance audits
- Debugging issues
- Change tracking
- Performance monitoring

## 📈 Performance Tips

1. **Cache Published Content**: Use React `cache()` for RSCs
2. **Use CDN for Images**: Store image URLs in CMS
3. **Pagination**: Fetch content in batches for large databases
4. **Search Indexing**: Full-text search on frequently queried fields
5. **Scheduled Publishing**: Set dates for automatic publishing

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized" on CMS Access
→ Admin session expired. Log in again at `/admin/login`

### Can't Find Published Content
→ Check page status is "Published", not "Draft"

### Page Not Showing on Website
